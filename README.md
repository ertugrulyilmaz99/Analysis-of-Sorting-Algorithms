# Analysis of Sorting Algorithms

This project includes four different sorting algorithms Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort. On report, the running time of each algorithm is calculated. Comparison of the algorithms is analyzed with three different categories these are; total number of rows repeated, number of comparisons and number of exchanges. Comparisons are showed in bar charts for different number of elements. 

# Code

Code includes the implementation of these sorting algorithms and comparison functions for different categories. Program has a simple UI on console to select the one of the comparison types.

# Charts

Bar charts are used to show the result of each algorithm. Mathplotlib is used.

# Conclusion

UI can be used to manage the program. Analysis of the results can be seen on the report.
